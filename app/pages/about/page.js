            <p>Ashley Rumsey</p>
            <p>BID Hons, NCIDQ, IDC, ARIDO, LEED AP</p>
            <p>Ashley Rumsey brings the highest standards to both the design vision of projects and the management of the Mason Studio team. An advocate of purposeful design, Ashley has been a key part of the development of Mason Studio’s innovative research-based process. She ensures design decisions are thoughtfully evaluated based on their potential contribution to the end user, design process, and client’s goals. Her collaborative approach ensures a broad-based perspective, leveraging the skills and knowledge of the entire team to fully inform each design project.

            <p>Stanley Sun</p>
            <p>BID Hons, BSC Hons, NCIDQ, IDC, ARIDO, BCIN</p>
            <p>Stanley Sun’s vision is informed by a unique blend of formal studies in human sciences, fine arts and interior design.  Approaching each challenge with a combined scientific and humanistic perspective, he first observes how people experience and react to the built environment to create a rational and intuitive design solution. Of particular interest to Stanley’s practice is the science of light and the physiological and psychological response people have to light.As an advocate for Canadian design, Stanley has been published widely and has participated as a keynote speaker at leading design conferences. He is also a sessional instructor at his alma mater, Toronto Metropolitan University.</p>
